## Hi there from Latvia ðŸ‘‹ :latvia:

I'm a passionate Software Developer with a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computing and a year of professional experience in web application development. My expertise lies in full-stack Java development, where I focus on building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly software solutions.

I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies and methodologies. Whether it's diving into front-end development, where I enjoy creating intuitive user interfaces, or working on the back end, I consider myself a true full-stack developer.

I'm constantly exploring new development tools and techniques to enhance my skill set and stay at the forefront of the industry. Let's build something amazing together!
